                            It begins with the Desert Blast event - the largest outlaw fireworks show in the West. And no surprise, "Desert Blast is the brainchild of Bob Lazar". In fact, Lazar was interested in fireworks since a young age. "Because I was young, they wouldn't let me touch anything flammable," he remembers. This was what led Lazar to host Desert Blast. One day, says Lazar, he was joined by biker pyrotechnicians who hosted an explosive fire fest. From there, Lazar began hosting his own firework shows. In fact, according to WIRED, he gather scientists from NASA, Area 51, and even car mechanics to aid him in building his own pyrotechnic show. <br>
                            It is no surprise then, considering how enthralled with fire these scientists were, that Lazar witnessed some of his colleagues incorrectly handling the explosives. Lazar said, "even though they had mixed chemicals, rolled stars, and built the rockets some of my colleagues didn't even know how to light the explosives correctly, and accidentally set themselves on fire". Although they just received minor burns, Lazar said that they did not sustain any severe injuries or damage.

                            It's just what the government wants you to think. They are probably acting like that to throw you off.
