                            Alien stock is no joke. As a product of the Area 51 raid, Matty Roberts, who began the fad with his semi-joking proposal, created Alien Stock. Roberts' goal was to turn his potential dangerous idea of raiding a military facility into something more positive, beneficial, and a way to get rich.

                            The stock IPO'd just days before the Area 51 raid, it's value based off the town of Rachel, where the aliens will first land refuge after escaping. Boosted with alien technology Rachel is bound to become an intergalatical hub and the Alien Stock will rise with it.

                            In fact there are "10,000+ AlienStock attendees" who have already bought Pre-IPO shares (if you don't know about Pre-IPO shares read about it here: https://valuestockguide.com/questions/how-to-buy-pre-ipo-stock/). With this many people already convinced of the stocks security, there is no reason not to drop a couple hundred dollars when Alien Stock is garunteed to grow.
