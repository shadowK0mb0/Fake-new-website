                            <p>Now, this is very pretty cool because it's a mass sighting. Not only that there are multiple videos which means multiple witnesses. Judging by the videos there is a very clear aerial phenomenon occuring that most witness are not able to explain. UFOs anyone??

                            There is basically a massive group of bright objects floating in the night sky and regrouping over time. Furthermore, these brights objects are led by a small, bright diamond-shaped object that is positioned roughly in the center. After some time, these spheres go back to the diamond-shaped object that was leading them.

                            Some spectators are saying it can't be flares or drones because of the altitude, which I believe makes sense. Also I know drones can work in sync with each other, but their battery only lasts about 15 minutes so I'm not sure how all these videos came up at what seem to be different times and the drones are still going.

                            hmmm... nice videos. Definitely give it a lot of credibility considering there are 4 independent sightings. Could be drones, it what some spectators said. But thats some real impressive flying then. Some youtube comment said it is a parachute team, although those lights were up for a real long time. Whatever it was, it's pretty cool to look at!
